# Modular Web App Development for Java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FenixEdu/bennu.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/FenixEdu/bennu)

Bennu is the foundation for building modular Java web applications based on the [fenix-framework](http://fenix-framework.github.io/). It provides a bunch of features out of the box so you can start developing your own applications and modules without worring about problems, like user authentication and management or task scheduling.

## Getting Started

To start developing using the Bennu Framework you should take a look to our documentation site:

[https://confluence.fenixedu.org/display/BENNU/Welcome](https://confluence.fenixedu.org/display/BENNU/Welcome)

It includes tutorials and examples so you can learn how to use the Bennu Framework

## Contribute

Bennu is open source LGPL 3. We welcome interest in the project and are open to your contributions
