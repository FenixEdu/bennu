## [**Localized String**](./localized-string.md)
Bennu comes out of the box with support for localisation. This allows you to have interfaces written in multiple languages, and switch between them. 

However sometimes you need to save a string in multiple languages, and display the correct one. Bennu supports this with the [LocalizedString](https://github.com/FenixEdu/fenixedu-commons/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/fenixedu/commons/i18n/LocalizedString.java) object. The toolkit comes with controllers to create and edit these objects in HTML.
