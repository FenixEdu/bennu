## [Toolkit](./toolkit.md)
Bennu Toolkit is a library that provides access to Bennu client-side and and provides a set small common controllers available as standard HTML and JavaScript.

They are designed to reduce the workload on the developers while maintaining a consistent user experience for user among Bennu Applications. It comes with support for two use patterns, standard HTML/JavaScript and Angular. 

If you are designing new applications you should favour this interface instead of the old Bennu Renderers.
